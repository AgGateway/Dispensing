# Mix Ticket: Dispensing Work Order and Work Record
Historically, customers of Process Control System software vendors would dictate a variety of custom formats and integration methods which would make implementation and support extremely challenging for both the customer and the process control system software vendor.  The AgGateway MixTicket Work Group has created work order and work record standards that lower the cost of implementation, and aid the addition of new facilities and standardized capabilities.

The scope of this resource to exchange work orders for blending/dispensing operations to create a finished good product, and to report the work order completions in the form of work records.  The work record communicates the actual ingredient and amounts consumed for the manufacturing operation. 

Logistical aspects may also be included with the work record to indicate specific carrier used to ship the product and attach a copy of the Bill of Lading provided to the carrier.
